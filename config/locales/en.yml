      paragraph_1: "Sydney was once a city whose best restaurants all came with 
        high price tags and glistening water views. And while those places are 
        still worth seeking out, a visit here wouldn’t be complete without 
        trying some of the smaller."
      paragraph_2: "Owned by a father and his sons, Shenkin is a true Sydney 
        standby. This casual Israeli cafe started small and has since grown to 
        four locations with full kitchens (all serve breakfast and lunch, the 
        Enmore location also serves dinner Thursday-Saturday) and a separate 
        espresso bar in Newtown. But they all still very much feel like 
        family-run businesses. Shenkin’s menu includes things like flaky pasties 
        filled with cheese, meat, and spinach, green and red shakshukas, and 
        large plates of housemade dips with flatbread - the kind of food we’d 
        be happy to eat pretty much anytime. There are a few things you must do 
        when you come to Sydney: see the Opera House, lie out on Bondi Beach, 
        and, if you’d like to spend a lot of money to be semi-terrified, climb 
        the Harbour Bridge. Eating a lamington - a cube of sponge cake dipped in 
        chocolate and covered in coconut - should also be on that list, and Flour 
        and Stone’s version (they soak theirs in panna cotta) is the best one in 
        the city. The bakery is small and popular, so if you can’t find a 
        table to sit with your coffee and cake, take it all"
